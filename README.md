## About the Video Course
This course will teach you one of the most powerful elements of the Java programming language, to help you start writing programs by coding the base functions needed and combining these functions into higher-level ones, repeating the process until you have a "single function" corresponding to the program you're building. Given their transparency, they can be reused to build other programs without any modifications, which saves time and allows you to focus on the further development of your project. From learning how to write more readable functional code, to processing discrete data sets using the stream interface and then writing your own Lambdas, this course has it all!
